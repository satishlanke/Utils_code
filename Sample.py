To ensure the automation works properly, the data in the Excel sheet named "Loan Position Detail" must be located on a sheet named "R Port Page," and the data table should start from the 6th row. If these conditions are not met, the automation will not function correctly.



We are going to use four Excel sheetsâ€”Loan Position Detail, Non-Cash Collateral, Income Repo, and Performance. Before uploading the data into the tool, please ensure it meets the specified criteria.
